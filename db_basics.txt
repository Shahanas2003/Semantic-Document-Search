Database Basics
===============

Databases are structured systems used to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.
They play a crucial role in modern applications ranging from web services to analytics platforms.

Types of Databases
------------------
1. **Relational Databases (RDBMS)** — Store data in tables with relationships. Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite.
2. **NoSQL Databases** — Handle unstructured data with flexible schemas. Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.
3. **Vector Databases** — Store high-dimensional embeddings for semantic similarity searches. Examples: FAISS, Pinecone, Milvus.

Core Concepts
--------------
- **Schema:** Defines the structure of data.
- **Query Language:** SQL is commonly used for interacting with RDBMS.
- **Indexing:** Helps in fast retrieval of records.

Applications
------------
Databases power applications like e-commerce, content management, finance systems, and machine learning pipelines.
Vector databases, in particular, are essential for AI-driven tasks such as semantic search and recommendation engines.
